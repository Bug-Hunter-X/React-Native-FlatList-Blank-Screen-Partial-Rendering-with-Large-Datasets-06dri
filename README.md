This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in React Native's FlatList component. When rendering a large dataset, the FlatList might display as a blank screen or only partially render the list, without providing clear error messages in the console.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides an optimized solution using techniques like pagination and data virtualization for improved performance and rendering.  This helps address the issue of inefficient data handling, a frequent cause of this rendering problem in large lists.
